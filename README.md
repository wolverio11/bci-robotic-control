\# BCI Robotic Control



End-to-end real-time Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) system

for robotic arm control using neural signal processing,

state-space decoding, and shared autonomy.



\## Objectives

\- Decode motor intent from neural signals (EEG / ECoG)

\- Control robotic arms in real time using ROS2

\- Emphasize reliability, low latency, and safety



\## Tech Stack

\- Python (NumPy, SciPy, MNE)

\- ROS2 (Humble)

\- Classical decoding (Linear models, Kalman filter)



\## Project Structure

\- `src/` – signal processing, decoding, control logic

\- `ros2\_ws/` – ROS2 workspace

\- `notebooks/` – experiments and analysis

\- `docs/` – design notes and weekly logs
